      <description>Overview Use simple language. Structure your text to make it clear. This example comes from a tutorial.
Before  Too verbose. No step name. No numbering.
 The last thing would be to select all layers for the form, including the white background and the shadow and group them together. With the newly formed Group selected fix both its width and height and fix it to the top from the Resizing panel on the right.</description>

 We can&amp;rsquo;t share this for you The file &amp;lsquo;filename&amp;rsquo; is too large to be shared to our servers. To make shares load faster, we restrict the size of each uploaded file/image to 6MB.
Can you make the file smaller and try again?</description>

      <description>Overview Keep titles goal-oriented and relevant to the purpose of the topic.
Before  Too vague. What&amp;rsquo;s the purpose?

After  Title shows purpose.
 Creating your first artboard This title reflects a concrete action and it gives the user an idea of what the goal of the tutorial is.</description>

      <description>Overview The text in a website should make good use of the visual space. Consider the space it takes up and not only the words in it.
Example  Similar text length
 In these titles and descriptions of features the length of the texts is purposefully similar.</description>
