      <description>Overview Use simple language. Structure your text to make it clear. This example comes from a tutorial.
Before The last thing would be to select all layers for the form, including the white background and the shadow and group them together. With the newly formed Group selected fix both its width and height and fix it to the top from the Resizing panel on the right. This will not change the final look of our design, but will make it act responsive if the artboard is resized.</description>

      <description>Overview Explain the reason for the error in plain language. Provide only relevant and useful information. Give users a way out.
Before We can&amp;rsquo;t share this for you The file &amp;lsquo;filename&amp;rsquo; is too large to be shared to our servers. To make shares load faster, we restrict the size of each uploaded file/image to 6MB.
Can you make the file smaller and try again?
Another option is exporting to HTML with no size limit.</description>

      <description>Overview The content and information in tutorials need to be clear and easy to find. This sample shows how to achieve this by naming and numbering steps, and editing to simplify the language.
Before From the insert menu, select Indigo-Components, then Navigation and Navbar positioning the Navbar at the top of the artboard and stretching it to take up the full witdth available. With the Navbar selected, fix its height and fix it to the left, top, and right from the resizing section in the right panel.</description>

      <description>Overview Keep titles goal-oriented and relevant to the purpose of the topic.
Before Getting started This title is too generic. When reading it, the user can&amp;rsquo;t have an idea of what the topic will be about. In the case of a tutorial, they don&amp;rsquo;t know what they will achieve after following the instructions.
 Too vague. What&amp;rsquo;s the purpose?
 After Creating your first artboard This title reflects a concrete action and it gives the user an idea of what the goal of the tutorial is.</description>

      <description>Overview The text in a website should make good use of the visual space. Consider the space it takes up and not only the words in it.
Example In these titles and descriptions of features the length of the texts is purposefully similar.
